# MinimalAPI ✧

## About📝
- <strong>This project is a simple MinimalAPI implementation created by me for the purpose of learning how they work. MinimalAPI is a lightweight framework for building APIs in .NET, designed to be simple and easy to use. With MinimalAPI, you can quickly create and deploy APIs without the overhead of more complex frameworks.
- This implementation includes a basic setup for creating endpoints, handling requests, and returning responses. It also demonstrates how to use different HTTP methods, handle errors, and implement middleware.
- Whether you're new to MinimalAPI or just looking for a simple example to get started with, this project is a great place to start. Feel free to use it as a reference for your own projects or to contribute to the MinimalAPI community.</strong>
